                    <p>
                        365binaryoption views its customers security as vital to our site’s integrity. Not only have we put in place a variety of security measures to ensure that the usage of the 365binaryoption’s platform is safe, but we constantly update and evaluate the site to safeguard the financial and personal safety of all our traders.

                    <h4>Binary Options Safety Tips</h4>
                    <p>
                        When using 365binaryoption, or any online trading site, there are measures each trader should take to ensure their personal security:
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span>Registration-</span></td>
                            <td>
                                <p>
                                We highly recommend that traders take extensive precautions to ensure that their usernames and passwords are not
                                seen by any unauthorized persons. 365binaryoption trader passwords are encrypted and cannot be seen by any
                                365binaryoption personnel or staff. 365binaryoption will under no circumstances ask a client to disclose their password.
                                Any such request should be viewed by traders as a security breech and immediately reported to the customer care
                                centre.
                                </p>

                            <td>
                                <p>
                                365binaryoption recommends that traders use a combination of characters and digits that are hard to be deciphered.
                                Traders would also be well-advised to periodically request a new password in order to maintain maximum security. If at
                                any point a trader comes to believe that their password’s security has been compromised, they should immediately
                                contact 365binaryoption’s customer care centre and change their password.
                                </p>
